    <h1>What is Divide and Rule</h1>
    <p>Divide and rule is a strategy where one power divides another power into smaller pieces so that each smaller
        piece has less power than the one that is doing the dividing. This strategy could be done so that the larger
        power can rule over and control those in the smaller, divided powers. Having the power divided results into
        smaller pieces that are much more manageable. The larger power has to also focus on keeping the smaller powers
        from uniting or creating alliances so that no revolutions occur. A few ways to do this is by fostering quarrels
        or distrust between the smaller powers, encouraging the smaller powers to spend money unwisely so that the
        smaller power has less for military and political spending, and helping those in the smaller powers that
        cooperate with the larger power. This strategy was used by both the British and Roman Empires.
